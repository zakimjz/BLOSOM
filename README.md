# BLOSOM Algorithm

The BLOSOM framework allows one to mine arbitrary frequent  boolean
expressions include AND clauses (itemsets), OR clauses, and CNF/DNF
expressions. It focuses on mining the minimal boolean expressions.

'''mug''' finds minimal or-clauses, and-clauses, CNF and DNF expressions

'''xng''' finds closed  CNF expressions

'''xug''' finds closed DNF expressions.

cd to the appropriate directory and run make

the ibm directory has some IBM format synthetic datasets generated via
http://github.com/zakimjz/IBMGenerator

See also CHARM-L (http://github.com/zakimjz/CHARM-L) that can mine all minimal and closed and-clauses, i.e., all minimal and closed frequent itemsets.
